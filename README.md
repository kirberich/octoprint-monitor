# octoprint-monitor
An arduino-based display for a 3d-printer running on octoprint. Very much geared towards use with a printrbot simple/plus, as it doesn't come with its own display. Needs an arduino and a sainsmart 1.3 inch SPI OLED screen, but should be easily adaptable to other screens supported by u8g.
